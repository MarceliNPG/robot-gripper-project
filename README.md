# Technical project of mechanical gripper 

This is a project done for Construction prototyping in 3D and CNC printing technology course at AGH UST.

## Goal 
Goal of this project was to design a gripper compatible with robotic arm keeping few conditions which are available in project sheet.
During completing tasks for this project I used:
- Autodesk Inventor - Computer-Aided Design program, used for creating of 3-D model and technical drawing,
- SAM 7.0 - program for mechanism design, used for model simulation,
- knowledge from AGH UST Physics course, used along whole modeling and designing process.

## Further informations
More informations are available in "gripper_project.pdf" file.
